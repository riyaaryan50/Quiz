## Tech Stack Used:
1. HTML Structure:
We start by defining the basic HTML structure, including the header, question container, answer options, and a submit button. Each question is represented by a separate HTML element to ensure modularity.

2. CSS Styling:
Using CSS, we can bring our app to life with appealing styles. We can define fonts, colors, backgrounds, borders, and animations to create an engaging user interface. By structuring our CSS code properly, we can ensure reusability and maintainability.

3. JavaScript Logic:
The heart of our quiz app lies in the JavaScript logic. We begin by storing our questions, answer options, and correct answers in variables or arrays. We then write JavaScript functions to handle user interaction, validate answers, calculate scores, and display results dynamically.

Happy Coding <3
